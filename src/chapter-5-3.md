Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged stress or frustration. When individuals engage in lifelong learning, they may become overwhelmed by the demands of coursework, training programs, or self-directed study. This can lead to burnout, which can negatively impact their motivation, productivity, and overall well-being.

To manage burnout, individuals should prioritize self-care, set realistic goals, and take breaks when needed. They should also seek out support from friends, family, or professionals if necessary. It's important to remember that lifelong learning is a journey, not a destination. Taking time to reflect on progress and celebrate accomplishments can help prevent burnout and maintain a positive attitude.
